# TOGA

## Overview

TOGA is a user-friendly solution to men's fashion essentials and combinations. It saves them from having to spend countless hours browsing clothing stores online and in person. The web app allows men to combine different types of tops, bottoms, and accessory categories, as well as play around with color palletes.
You can discover new color combos and ways to combine men's fashion essentials such as bombers, jeans, chinos, polos, jackets, hoodies, etc. Just select the clothing type and color for each category and press generate - TOGA will give you an AI generated preview of what your new outfit could look like.
Users can also save the generated outfits in their account section and revisit at any time.
